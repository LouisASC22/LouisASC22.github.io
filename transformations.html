<h3><span class="big-headline" id="Great_Ape">Great Ape</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-29-Oct-2022-0524-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his great ape form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    When Goku still had his tail and when he stares into a full moon or absorbing 17 million units of Blutz Waves through the eyes he becomes the Great Ape: Ozaru. This transformation multiplies the saiyan's power by ten, another common occurrence is that Goku goes berserk in this form losing almost all sense of though because he never trained in this form like Vegeta or Nappa. Those in the Great Ape Form can also shoot beams from their mouth as a possible homage to Godzilla's Atomic Breath.
</p>
<h3><span class="big-headline" id="Super_Saiyan">Super Saiyan</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-29-Oct-2022-0554-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his super saiyan form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    After reaching a high level of power and entering a fit of rage, the rank of a Super Saiyan was founded. The amount of times stronger varies by who you ask, In Daizenshuu 7 the form is said to multiply the Saiyan's power level by 50 times times its normal amount.
</p>
<h3><span class="big-headline" id="Super_Saiyan_2">Super Saiyan 2</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-29-Oct-2022-0602-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his super saiyan 2 form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    After training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Goku acsessed his Super Saiyan 2 form, however gained only gained this form after death. This form multiplies all stats in the Super Saiyan form by 2.
</p>
<h3><span class="big-headline" id="Super_Saiyan_3">Super Saiyan 3</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-29-Oct-2022-0604-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his super saiyan form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    While training after death, he gained the form of Super Saiyan 3. This multiplies the Super Saiyan 2 form by 4. This form focuses on the utilization of ki in exchange for enourmous energy consumption.
</p>
<h3><span class="big-headline" id="Super_Saiyan_God">Super Saiyan God</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collage-Maker-01-Nov-2022-0207-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his super saiyan god form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    With the power of five pure-hearted Saiyans, Goku was able to become a Super Saiyan God. This is the only transformation with a time limit; all Super Saiyan God's are immune to godly dark magic like Demigra's. The multiplier while unknown, should have to be at least by 20,000 as goku stated that even if Goku and Vegeta fused, they would be no match for Beerus.
</p>
<h3><span class="big-headline" id="Super_Saiyan_Blue">Super Saiyan Blue</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-29-Oct-2022-0711-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his super saiyan blue form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    After becoming a Super Saiyan while still retaining his godly ki, Goku can transform in to a Super Saiyan Blue, or Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. This form has enough power to be stronger than suppressed Beerus from when he fought Super Saiyan God Goku, but he is still weaker then Golden Frieza.
</p>
<h3><span class="big-headline" id="Super_Saiyan_Blue_Kaio-ken">Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-29-Oct-2022-0713-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his super saiyan kaio ken form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    He can use his Kaio-ken and Super Saiyan Blue at the same time. Although, it initially had only a 10% chance of working and a 90% chance of killing him. Thus, Goku must maintain an extraordinary amount of focus when activating the technique in order to ensure its success. While using it, Goku was strong enough to move through Hit's Time-Skip technique. He has yet to master this technique. Back then, Goku could multiply the power of Kaioken up to ten times, but now he can push it to twenty times with relative ease.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ultra_Instinct">Ultra Instinct</span></h3>
<img class="big-image" src="https://static1.dualshockersimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-29-Oct-2022-0734-PM.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5" alt="Goku in his ultra instinct form" style="width:40%">
<p>
    Goku has yet to learn how to use this form, but in this form he has complete focus during a fight, as he does not need to think with this form. It is a perfection of reaction. The form doesn't only increase his reaction time, he also gets a major power boost as he was able to keep up with Jiren, who before was able to fodderize Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-Ken X20 like it was nothing.
