<!--Various powers that Goku has-->
<ul>
    <li><b>Ki: </b>Ki is the energy of life that is stored inside every living being in the Dragon Ball universe. Goku can manipulate his own ki for a variety of different abilities, like enhancing physical abilities, hardening his skin, creating force fields, defying gravity to achieve flight, or discharging it as blasts of destructive energy.</li>
    <li><b>Kamehameha</b>: Invented by Master Roshi, the Kamehameha is when the user draws ki into their hands and then fires an explosive beam of energy. Many variations have been created like the Feet Kamehameha, Instant Kamehameha, and so on.</li>
    <li><b>Dragon Fist</b>: Goku makes a straight fist at the opponent, then when Goku passes through the opponent's stomach or chest, the energy of the fist will be massively amplified, with the ki also exploding into a Golden Dragon resembling Shenron.
    <li><b>Super Dragon Fist</b>: Same as the regular Dragon Fist, but with even more power after absorbing a Spirit Bomb.</li></li>
    <li><b>Instant Transmission</b>: Goku locks onto a sensible form of ki and then instantly moves from one location to another.</li>
    <li><b>Invisible Eye Blast</b>: Goku shoots invisible ki blasts from his eyes, however, he rarely uses this technique.</li>
    <li><b>Destructo Disc</b>: Goku holds his hand into the air, conducting ki in the form of a razor-sharp disc, which is then hurled at the target to slice them in half.</li>
    <li><b>Solar Flare</b>: Emits a flash of light to blind everything around the user.</li>
    <li><b>Spirit Bomb</b>: Goku's ultimate attack, which he learned from King Kai. After gathering energy from every living thing around him, Goku can concentrate the energy into a ball of ki that possesses incredible destructive power. The Spirit Bomb is capable of destroying a planet if the user isn't careful, though people with a pure heart are capable of deflecting it. If the user's heart isn't pure, the move could possibly kill them if they attempt to use it. Goku can also absorb the Spirit Bomb's energy, supercharging him and granting him an incredible power boost.</li>
    <li><b>Hasshu-ken</b>: This involves Goku moving his fists so fast that he seemingly has eight arms, allowing Goku to attack and defend much more efficiently.</li>
    <li><b>Penetrate!: </b>By firing a Kamehameha at the ground with one hand, Goku propels himself at the opponent and punches through them with an energy-powered fist.</li>
    <li><b>Afterimage Technique</b>: Moving so swiftly that that Goku's image is left behind, confusing the opponent.</li>
    <li><b>Healing</b>: Uses his ki to heal others.</li>
    <li><b>Telepathy</b>: Can read minds, eavesdrop on telepathic conversations, and converse with others through their minds.</li>
    <li><b>Telekinesis</b>: Lets Goku lift objects with his mind. However just like the invisible eye blast, he rarely uses this ability.</li>
    <li><b>Evil Containment Wave</b>: A technique that can seal anyone away by sucking them into a container with a special "Demon Seal" ofuda on it. The move requires so much of the user's life force to perform that those who use it are likely to die soon afterward, despite the success of the technique. The drawbacks of the technique can be negated if one posses enough power to use it without dying.</li>
    <li><b>Zenkai: </b>A Saiyan genetic trait, where they experience a massive power increase after surviving a fatal injury.</li>
    <li><b>Kaio-ken: </b>A power-up that Goku learned from King Kai, which multiples his ki for a short burst, enhancing his strength, speed, endurance, and senses most commonly by two. The highest enhancement of the Kaio-Ken he has done was by 100. However, the Kaio-ken takes a toll on the user's body when used, possibly causing them severe damage if overused.</li>
</ul>
