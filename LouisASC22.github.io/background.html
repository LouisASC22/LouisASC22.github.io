Goku was born on Planet Vegeta, named Kakarot. He was the son of the Saiyan Bardock, and was sent to Earth due to Frieza destroying Planet Vegeta. His mission was to destroy it, but he was dropped on his head and forgot it, when being adopted by Grandpa Gohan, not to be confused with Goku's son, Gohan.
